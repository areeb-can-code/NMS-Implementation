    <p>As a student of network scripting and management, I am thrilled to showcase my project on a web-based Network Management system that includes Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security Management features. This system is designed to be easy to use and navigate, and it is built using a range of technologies, including SNMP, Python scripting, and bash scripting, all within a CGI environment.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fault Management: This feature includes identifying link up and down events with a red or green color, showing the most recent 30 events in reverse order, and using a Python script to convert for the CGI environment.</li>
        <li>Configuration Management: The Configuration Management page shows device configuration information and system information, provisions and updates system information, and enables or disables network interfaces.</li>
        <li>Accounting Management: This page provides usage reports.</li>
        <li>Performance Management: This page includes Throughput, System Load Report, and RTT Report.</li>
        <li>Security Management: This page includes the intrusion detection report, showing IP addresses with more than 20 failures, and all syslog data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am proud of the hard work that went into creating this project and excited to share it with others in the industry. Please feel free to explore the site and reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.</p>
    <p>Enjoy your stay</p>
